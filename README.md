# RC2014 SNES Controller Module

This RC2014 module will allow the connection of up to four SNES-compatible
game controllers or mice to your system, using a single I/O port of your
choice.

Note: This design is untested, but I am very confident it works. If you
find a bug, please let me know.

This repository provides ready-to-use Gerber files for having this board
made, as well as PDF and EasyEDA JSON format schematics, for designing
your own version of the hardware, which you are encouraged to do if you
wish.

The design of this module is released under the CERN Open Hardware License,
version 1.2, a copy of which is found in the file "license.txt" at the root
of this repository.
